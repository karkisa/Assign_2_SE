# Assign_2_SE

## Why this file
The py file in the repo genrates server that mocks the contens of the OpenWeater.org website output and displays on local server.

##  Further tasks 
We use this py file and run this on the ec2 instance.
Initiate the instances.
Add apropriate settings to the security group.
Git clone this repo
Run the pyhton file using pyhon3 
Now that the server is up and running we can use the public Ipv4 adress from the instance page and paste is on new tab and run it.
We can now see our sever being hosted on AWS.

## Keep it going
To keep the server functonal even after we end the instance and kill it..  the site should still be functional.
This can be done using nohup in the instances terminal throgh apropriate commands
Once that has been established ... We can keep the site up and running until we want

# to visit the running server hosted using aws
